     * to add fancy names to things to feel better about things like

     * To use async/await, we need to mark our function as async, as can be seen
     * in the test function for this portion of the lesson. This then let's us
     * use the `await` keyword for Promises. Behind the scenes, you can think
     * of it as attaching the `.then()` part to a promise and returning that
     * value.
     *
     * What about the `.catch()` part? That's handled by a catch block. An
     * important thing to remember is to always surround `await` statements with
     * a try/catch block.

   * You should always wrap await statements with a try/catch block.
   * If you aren't comfortable with Promises, you can supply a callback to the
   * Node driver methods that are asynchronous.
   * If you don't pass a callback, a Promise will be returned.
