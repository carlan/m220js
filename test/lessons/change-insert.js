      The fields available to us in each change event will vary depending on the
      operation, but operation type will always appear, along with clusterTime.
      Operation type tells us whether it was an insert, update or delete, and
      clusterTime tells us the time when the operation completed.

      The fullDocument field appears in insert change events, and it gives us
      the entire document that was just inserted. We can also return this to the
      change stream cursor for update operations, we just have to ask for it
      specifically - we'll cover that in a bit.

      The updateDescription field only appears in update operations, and it
      tells us which fields were updated and which fields were removed from the
      existing document.
