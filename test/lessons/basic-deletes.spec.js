    Now let's try to delete a document using deleteOne()
    The first thing to understand is that a delete operation is in fact
    a write in database world. Confused? What I mean by this is that
    when we delete a document from our database we are actually
    executing a state change in the data, that implies a database write
    Deletes imply that several different things will happen:
    - collection data will be changed
    - indexes will be updated
    - entries in the oplog (replication mechanism) will be added.

    All the same operations that an insert or an update would originate.

    But let's go ahead and see this in action with a single document
    delete.

    Before I start deleting data from my collection I'm going to count
    the number of documents in the sports collection.

    // Let's test to see if the delete was successful.

  // Wait, but which document did I just remove from the collection?
  // Well, in this case MongoDB will select the first $natural document
  // it encounters in the collection and delete that one.
