/**

 Let's Summarize:

 Querying MongoDB through the Driver may feel odd at first, but eventually
 it will feel like second nature.

 We saw how to retrieve one document using findOne or get all documents that
 match a query filter. We also saw how to include only the the fields we
 wanted in the result set, and how to remove the _id field.

 A few things to keep in mind:

 Finding one document typically involves querying on a unique index,
 such as the _id field.

 When projecting, by specifying inclusion (for example, title: 1) all
 fields we don't include will be excluded, except for the _id field. If
 we don't want the _id field returned to us we must explicitly exclude
 it in the projection stage.
