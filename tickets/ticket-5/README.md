Ticket: Faceted Search
======================

**Problem:**

**User Story**

"As a user, I want to be able to filter cast search results by one facet, **metacritic** rating."

---

**Task**

For this Ticket, you'll be required to implement one method in _moviesDAO.js_, **facetedSearch**, so the MFlix application can perform faceted searches.

What is a Faceted Search?

Faceted search is a way of narrowing down search results as search parameters are added. For example, let's say MFlix allows users to filter movies by a rating from 1 to 10, but Kate Winslet has only acted in movies that have a rating of 6 or higher.

If we didn't specify any other search parameters, MFlix would allow us to choose a rating between 1 and 10. But if we first search for Kate Winslet, MFlix would only let us choose a rating between 6 and 10, because none of the movie documents in the result set have a rating below 6.

_Faceted Search in MFlix_

Faceted searches on the MFlix site cannot be supported with the basic search method **getMovies**, because that method uses the Mongo query language. For faceted searches, the application must use the Aggregation Framework.

The method **facetedSearch ** uses the Aggregation Framework, and the individual stages in the pipeline have already been completed. Follow instructions in the _moviesDao.js_ file to add the required stages to the pipeline object.

**MFlix Functionality**

By default, faceted searches are not enabled. To enable faceted search in the UI, open the **index.html** file and enter:

```
useFacets: true
```

in the **mflix** object.

Once implemented, the available movie search parameters will reflect the other search criteria.
